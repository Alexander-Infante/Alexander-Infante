## Hi there, I'm Alexander Infante and these are my open source contributions.

### I'm a big fan of:

- GraphQL
- Go
- Node.js
- Functional React
- Redis
- AWS

### Nontechnical things I enjoy:

- Hiking around California, particularly off trail
- Taking photos (Laguna Beach makes it so easy to capture great photos)
- Reading (both technical and nontechnical books)

### Let me know if I can help you somehow
