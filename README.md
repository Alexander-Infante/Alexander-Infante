# Alexander C. Infante
Hi, I'm Alexander - my GitHub profile is full of my open source contributions, projects I've been working on that are public, and other random things I've been interested in working on. I'm a Southern California native, having grown up in the suburbs right on the border of Los Angeles County/ Orange County. 

I also have a personal website where I write about my experiences with certain tech stacks in hopes to help others get started. Feel free to check it out!

[My Personal Website](https://alexander-infante.dev/)

### I'm a big fan of:

- GraphQL
- Go
- Node.js
- React (React hooks especially)
- Redis
- AWS

### Nontechnical things I enjoy:

- Hiking around California, particularly off trail
- Taking photos (Laguna Beach makes it so easy to capture great photos)
- Reading (both technical and nontechnical books)

### Let me know if I can help you somehow
